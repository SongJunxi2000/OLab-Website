              <br/>
              <p>
                Oblivious Labs Inc. was founded by Professor Elaine Shi in December 2023, with a mission to bring oblivious algorithms into real-world systems. Our vision is to bridge the gap between advanced cryptographic theory and industry-ready privacy solutions.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’re building a world where secure, privacy-preserving infrastructure is the default — not the exception.
